It is the same as used by `adminAuth` as described in the [security documentation](http://nodered.org/docs/security), but without the `password` property.\n\nA default user can be specified by adding a `default` property to the options object:\n\n        users: [\n           ...\n        ],\n        default: {\n            permissions: \"read\"\n        }\n\n## Copyright and license\n\nCopyright JS Foundation and other contributors, http://js.foundation under [the Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).\n",
